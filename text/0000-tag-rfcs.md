# Summary
[summary]: #summary

It would be nice to start tagging RFCs with a label that indicates which part
of the specification (i.e Buildpack Interface, Distribution, Platform
Interface) the RFC is making purposed changes to.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Indicating which part of the specification the RFC is trying to update or
modify, the RFC will become more digestible because it will allow people to
hone focus in on certain RFCs that effect them. This means that potentially
effected parties have to spend less time wading through all of the RFCs in the
repository to find the handful that will affect them. Overall, this change will
make reviewing RFCs a much more manageable process for new members and people
that are concerned with specific parts of the specification.
